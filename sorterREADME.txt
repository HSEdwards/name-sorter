Welcome to name sorter.
This project takes a list of names and sorts them first by size,
and then alphabetially within each size.

To use this program, run it through the command line along with
the location of the file you want to sort.

Formatting will look like
python3 /c/users/exampleFolder/nameSorter.py /c/users/exampleFolder2/'File Name.txt'

When the program begins the users will have the option to sort the list of names by length (short to long) and alpabetically
or reversed (long to short and z-a). The system will print out the ordered list and ask if the user would like to sort the list in another way.

Attached is an sort me test/example file to see how the program runs.
