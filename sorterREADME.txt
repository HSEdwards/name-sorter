Welcome to name sorter.
This project takes a list of names and sorts them first by size,
and then alphabetially within each size.

To use this program, run it through the command line along with
the location of the file you want to sort.

Formatting will look like
python3 /c/users/exampleFolder/nameSorter.py /c/users/exampleFolder2/'File Name.txt'

Attached is an sort me test/example file to see how the program runs.
